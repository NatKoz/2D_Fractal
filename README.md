## 2D Fractal Structure project
___

Goal of the project is to generate a fractal structure using Python with some color added.
The hierarchical structure was reshaped to calculate an optimal random fractal pattern. Random fractals are method of choice for the purpose of computer image synthesis. The density of structure can be reduced and increased based on the given parameters.

Fractals are represented by trees. A general approach to capture the self-similar nature of fractals is by means of trees with vertices associated to the edges. A tree T = (V, E) consists of a finite or countable set V of vertices and a set E of edges. The root is considered to be the first vertex particle position - here established as the center of the board. From the root vertex there is a connecting line or a bridge to the next vertex called edge. A sophisticated example with results on the fine structure of  Brownian motion make great use of tree representations. Representation of randomly chosen tree have random sets. The start point of perfect center vertex map the Brownian curve. The Brownian curve chan hit the boundary, whenever the motion moves from the set in code boundary to another boundary.  Typical examples of the fractals studied are the boundary of excursions of random fields [1].

Brownian motion is the archetype of a random process, hence its great importance in physics and probability theory. The Brownian path is also the archetype of a scale invariant set, and in two dimensions is a conformally-invariant one. It is therefore perhaps the most natural random fractal [3].

Essential to produce random fractal patterns is in the system to give rise to the ensemble of final aggregates. This process is called the diffusion-limited aggregation DLA type to present some randomness. The diffusion-limited aggregation process was used in the project where particles undergo a random walk due to Brownian motion cluster to form aggregates of particles. The clusters formed in DLA processes referred to as Brownian trees. Brownian trees are mathematical models of dendritic structures which is crystal that develops with a typical multi-branching form. The process of agregats growth is essentially deterministic, and that the initial stages of growth serve as a kind of initial condition for the subsequent stages. The random initial conditions serve to nucleate instabilities which grow into clusters and interact to produce the fractal pattern [2]. The random fractal geometry is particularly rich in two dimensions [3]. 


Some variations were observed depending on size and particle count parameters in the geometry of the growth. Examples of aggregates were generated by allowing random walkers to adhere to an aggregate and are shown on the Figures in Table 1. 

Factors influencing the shape of the tree:
* the root vertex position,
* the initial particle/vertex position (from a circle surrounding the root vertex),
* the moving algorithm.

Diffusion process steps: 
1. A root vertex was placed in the center on the screen.
2. A particle/vertex was placed in a random position of the screen, and moved randomly until it bumps against the root vertex.
3. The particle/vertex is left there, and another particle/vertex is placed in a random position and moved until it bumps against the root vertex or any previous particle/vertex, and so on.

Some variations were observed depending on size and particle count parameters in the geometry of the growth. Examples of aggregates were generated by allowing random walkers to adhere to an aggregate and are shown on the Figures and in Table nr 1.

###  ðŸ§© Examples of use
___

Major aspects of the application of random fractals: 

* the modeling and characterization of natural forms and processes - a physically based, accurate model that reflects all relevant aspects of the phenomenon and is in good agreement with theory and experiment. The goal is to improve understanding of the natural phenomenon in order to make predictions possible. Such modeling and analysis is of prime concern to many scientific areas dealing directly with nature (physics, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy and so on) [4],

* pattern formation of random fractals may be one of the most interesting problems in non-equilibrium statistical physics now [5].

### ðŸ’¡ Interesting facts
___

* Described trees can also be grown easily in an electrodeposition cell and are the direct result of diffusion-limited aggregation.

* Polymer theory and in second-order phase transitions and field theories: uses the the equivalence of Brownian path represented by line propagator and the vertices which are intersection points of the Brownian paths. [3] Mathematical Statistical Physics
